# Visibility Graph

After reading some papers on graphs and time series. I came across this approach on how we can utilize time series data to make graphs. These graphs are called visibility graphs as you can see in the animation, the points are connected based on visibility of towers which represent values at different time points. Based on these we can map out graphs based on different rolling window. Each window will can represent a graph.

With this graph, we can derive vector representation as it can be utilized for down-stream predictions. This offers more information not just values at different time points but also spatiotemporal
